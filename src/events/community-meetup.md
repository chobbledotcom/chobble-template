Join the Chobble template revolution as our passionate developers take to the streets of Fulchester! We're on a mission to democratise web development by showing random passers-by how they can build stunning websites using the Chobble template and deploy them instantly to Neocities.

## What We Do

- **Live street coding**: Build a complete website in under 10 minutes whilst dodging pigeons
- **Guerrilla tutorials**: Ambush unsuspecting shoppers with Eleventy knowledge
- **Megaphone manifestos**: Proclaim the benefits of static site generation to anyone within earshot
- **Flash mob deployments**: Spontaneous group website launches in front of Primark

## Typical Session Activities

- Setting up impromptu coding stations outside The Bacon Rasher café
- Converting buskers' websites to Chobble whilst they perform
- Racing to build sites faster than people can finish their pies
- Distributing "I Met a Chobble Developer" stickers to bewildered tourists
- Live-streaming builds to Neocities whilst explaining JAMstack to confused pensioners

**Roger Mellie** enthuses: "This Chobble thing is absolutely brilliant! I mean, even after a heavy night at the Dog and Trumpet, I managed to knock up a professional website. It's easier than... well, it's very easy!"

**Billy the Fish** adds: "When I'm not scoring overhead kicks for Fulchester United, I'm building lightning-fast static sites with Chobble. It's helped me launch my football boot endorsement site in record time!"
