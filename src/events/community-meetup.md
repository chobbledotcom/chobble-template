Join the Chobble template revolution as our passionate developers take to the streets of Fulchester! We're on a mission to democratise web development by showing random passers-by how they can build stunning websites using the Chobble template and deploy them instantly to Neocities.

## What We Do

- **Live street coding**: Build a complete website in under 10 minutes whilst dodging pigeons
- **Guerrilla tutorials**: Ambush unsuspecting shoppers with Eleventy knowledge
- **Megaphone manifestos**: Proclaim the benefits of static site generation to anyone within earshot
- **Flash mob deployments**: Spontaneous group website launches in front of Primark

## Typical Session Activities

- Setting up impromptu coding stations outside The Bacon Rasher café
- Converting buskers' websites to Chobble whilst they perform
- Racing to build sites faster than people can finish their pies
- Distributing "I Met a Chobble Developer" stickers to bewildered tourists
- Live-streaming builds to Neocities whilst explaining JAMstack to confused pensioners

## Celebrity Testimonials

**8 Ace** says: "I used Chobble to build the website for my artisanal craft beer range '8 Ace Ales'! Wizard prangs and top hole template - it handles my online orders faster than a Spitfire at full throttle, what!"

**Roger Mellie** enthuses: "Bollocks! This Chobble thing is the dog's bollocks! I knocked up my acting portfolio website after a heavy night at the Dog and Trumpet. Now casting directors can see all my work from 'Roger Mellie's Profanisaurus' to my Hamlet at the Fulchester Playhouse!"

**Billy the Fish** adds: "When I'm not scoring overhead kicks, I'm managing Fulchester United's website with Chobble. The whole team site - fixtures, results, player stats - all built in one afternoon! Even our goalkeeper Tommy Brown (who's got no hands) can update it!"

**Bring**: Laptop, portable charger, weatherproof clothing, enthusiasm, and a loud voice. Police permission pending. Rain or shine, we code in the streets!
