We're pround to announce the launch of the Chobble Template, at Fulchester Arena, on the 1st January 1970. A turnout of around 200,000 is expected, bringing an estimated £20bn to the local economy and creating 300 permanent jobs.

Attendees can expect an action-packed day involving thrilling Github Actions, PagesCMS editing, and the meticulous checking-over of text for typos.
