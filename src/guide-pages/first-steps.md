Now that you have everything installed, let's take your first steps.

## Understanding the Structure

The project is organised into several key directories:

- `src/` - All your source content
- `src/_layouts/` - Page templates
- `src/_includes/` - Reusable components
- `src/_data/` - Site configuration

## Making Your First Edit

Try editing `src/_data/site.json` to change your site's name and description. Save the file and watch your browser automatically refresh with the changes.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, move on to the Advanced Topics section to learn about customisation options.
