Blimey! The Chobble template is absolutely smashing! I'm Mr Fakeman (my parents had a brilliant sense of humour), and I've been developing websites since the internet was invented yesterday. The responsive images with base64 placeholders? Genius! The Formspark and Botpoison integration? Spot on!

The fact it includes Turbo for instant page navigation makes me want to weep tears of joy. And don't even get me started on the automatic HTML tidying with Prettier - it's like having a butler for your code!
