Absolutely gobsmacked by the Chobble template! As someone who definitely exists and isn't made up at all, I can confidently say this Eleventy starter is the bee's knees. The built-in support for galleries, reviews, and products? Brilliant! The fact it comes with Nix flakes and direnv support? Chef's kiss! I've built seventeen websites with it this week alone (I'm very productive for someone who doesn't exist).
