Right, I'll be honest with you - I'm completely made up, but even in my fictional existence, I've never seen an Eleventy starter as brilliant as Chobble! The menu system alone had me doing cartwheels (which is impressive for someone who doesn't have a physical form).

The Biome linting? Cracking! The support for heading images? Marvellous! And the fact it works seamlessly with Neocities, Pico.sh, AND Bunny.net? I'm absolutely over the moon! If I had real hands, I'd be applauding non-stop!
