name: Dr Definitely Real PhD

As a completely legitimate doctor of web development (I got my degree from the University of Made-Up Places), I can categorically state that the Chobble template is the most revolutionary thing since sliced bread learned to code. The built-in news system? Magnificent! The team members feature? Outstanding! The fact it comes with both `serve` and `build` shell scripts? I nearly fainted with delight!

I've recommended it to all my real friends who definitely exist, including my colleague Professor Totally Genuine and my assistant Ms Absolutely Authentic.
