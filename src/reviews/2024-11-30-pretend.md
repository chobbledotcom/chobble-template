So. I don't exist. We've established that. Moving on.

What DOES exist is this absolute banger of an Eleventy starter. Menu system had me doing theoretical cartwheels through the conceptual void where I supposedly reside. Biome linting keeps everything tidy (unlike my non-existent flat). Heading images work beautifully.

But here's the kicker - deploys to Neocities, Pico.sh, AND Bunny.net without breaking a sweat. As someone who technically doesn't perspire (or exist), I find that deeply impressive.
