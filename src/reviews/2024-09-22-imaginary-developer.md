Cor blimey! After spending my entirely fictional career building websites with every framework under the sun (which I can see from my imaginary office), I can honestly say the Chobble template is the dog's bollocks!

The categories system? Brilliant! The customisable strings feature? Proper clever! The fact it generates canonical URLs automatically? I'm chuffed to bits! My imaginary wife (Lady Nonexistent) says I won't shut up about how the CSS bundling works in production but not in development. It's pure genius, I tell you!
