This is another team member page showing how multiple members appear in the collection. The team folder can contain any number of markdown files and each one generates a page. Files are processed alphabetically by filename so you can prefix filenames with numbers to control the order.

The layout renders the profile image at multiple widths for responsive display on different screen sizes. When viewed on the team listing page, the image links to this page. The collection is defined in team.json which sets the default layout and adds the team tag used by Eleventy to group these files together.
