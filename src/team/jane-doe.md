This is another team member page. You can add as many team members as you want. Just put more files in the team folder. Each file makes a page. The files show in order by filename. You can put numbers at the start of filenames to change the order.

The photo shows in different sizes for different screens. In the team list, you can click the photo to come to this page. The team.json file tells the site how to build these pages.
