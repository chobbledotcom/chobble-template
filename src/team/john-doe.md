This page demonstrates the team member layout. The title field in the frontmatter sets the name displayed in the heading and listings. The image field references a file in the images folder and appears on both this page and the team listing. The header_image provides the banner at the top of this page. The snippet appears below the name in the team listing.

The markdown content below the frontmatter becomes the biography. You can use any markdown formatting here including headings, lists, links, and blockquotes like the one above. The page includes a breadcrumb linking back to the team listing and uses the same header and footer as the rest of the site.
