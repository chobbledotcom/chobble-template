Socks all over the planet were blown clean off today with the launch of the new blogging system on the Chobble Template. A stunned industry observer remarked:

> "I've used a lot of news systems on websites before, and this is definitely one of them."

With features such as **dated posts**, an **RSS feed**, and **subtitles**, alongside **a list of old posts**, experts agree that this system could definitely be used for storing news articles on the website of a small business owner.

For those looking to catch a glimpse of the new Chobble blogging system, we asked lead Chobble developer Stefan to give his insights into the easiest way. He said:

> "You're looking at it right now. Unless someone is reading these words to you.
>
> If that's the case, ask them to show you their screen, or to describe what they're seeing."

The new blogging system is built on the [Chobble Template](/), an Eleventy starter for business websites created by [Chobble](https://chobble.com) - an open source web developer in Prestwich, Manchester.

**If you'd like to experience the Chobble blog system from the other side of the screen - as the author - then you can either follow [these instructions](/instructions/) to deploy the Chobble Template by yourself, or else [contact Chobble](https://chobble.com/contact/) and ask me to build a site for you!**
