title: Second Blog Post Fails To Excite
subtitle: Hopes dashed as world's troubles continue despite blog
---

Disappointment today as the world realised that war, famine, and strife continued unabated despite the creation of the Chobble Blog system (see our [in-depth investigation on the issue](/news/first/)).

We met Chobble developer Stefan outside his Prestwich residence where he had this to say:

> "I always thought it was a bit much to put the whole hopes of the planet on the success of an honestly pretty simple blog system, but once everyone got so excited I didn't want to be a party pooper.
>
> In hindsight I shouldn't have accepted that Nobel Peace Prize."

**If you'd like a totally normal news system for your website, [contact Chobble today](https://chobble.com) to get the ball rolling on building a website with this template. It's very easy to edit thanks to [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org).**

Or depending on your level of bravery, you might want to try [building this website yourself](/instructions/). It's easier than that might sound, I promise.
