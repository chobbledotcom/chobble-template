## Meet the Team

Team members are files in the team folder. Each file makes its own page and shows up in this list. The file has a title for the name, an image for the photo, a header_image for the banner, and a snippet for the short text shown here.

This list shows each person's photo, name, and snippet. Click the photo to go to their page. The text you write in the file becomes their story on their page. Their page has a link back to this list.
