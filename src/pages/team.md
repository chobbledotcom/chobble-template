## Meet the Team

Team members are stored as markdown files in the team folder. Each file generates its own page at /team/filename/ and appears in this listing. The frontmatter includes a title for the person's name, an image for their photo, a header_image for the banner on their page, and a snippet for the summary text shown in listings.

The listing displays each member's photo as a link to their page, their name, and their snippet. Photos are rendered at multiple sizes for responsive display. The markdown content of each file becomes the biography on their page, where it appears below a breadcrumb linking back to this team listing.
