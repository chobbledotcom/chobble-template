# Locations

This page shows locations. Locations are files in the locations folder. Each location can have a list of product categories. The location page will show products from those categories.

Locations can have sub-pages for services. Put a markdown file in a folder with the same name as the location. The sub-page will appear under that location and link to sibling services.

Properties can link to locations. When a property lists a location slug, it shows up on that location page. Each location page also shows links to other locations in the area list.
