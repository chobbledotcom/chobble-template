# Our Products

This page shows product categories. Categories are files in the categories folder. You can put categories inside other categories to group them. Categories with featured set to true show up here.

Products are files in the products folder. A product can be in more than one category. You can add prices, a list of features, a table of specs, questions and answers, and photos. You can also link reviews to products. The reviews will show with star ratings.

You can let people filter products. To do this, turn on filtering in the config file. Then add filter options to your products. The site makes a page for each filter choice.
