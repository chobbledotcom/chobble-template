# Chobble: Distilled USP & EEAT Improvement Guide

## Part 1: Who Chobble Is (Distilled Identity)

**One-liner:** Stef is an independent, principle-driven web developer in Prestwich, Manchester with 20+ years of experience who builds fast, transparent, open-source websites for small businesses — especially ethical ones.

### Core Identity Pillars

1. **Radical Transparency** — All code is AGPLv3 open source. No secrets. Clients own everything. No vendor lock-in, no contracts.
2. **Ethical Selectivity** — 50% discount for charities, co-ops, artists, musicians, vegans, renewables. Refuses work from exploitative industries. Donates 10% to Against Malaria Foundation.
3. **Technical Depth with Plain-English Delivery** — 20+ years building for the web, from static site generators to Rails apps to Linux servers, but communicates in jargon-free language to small business owners.
4. **Anti-Rent-Seeking** — "My income should come from doing work, not from charging rent." Flat hourly rate (£200/hr, £100 discounted). No mandatory monthly fees. No upsells.
5. **Local & Personal** — Based in Prestwich, Manchester. One person. One-on-one support. Word-of-mouth reputation.

### What Chobble Actually Does

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Static websites (Eleventy/Chobble Template) | Fast, SEO-optimized brochure & e-commerce sites on Bunny CDN |
| SEO audits & content advice | Hands-on analysis, actionable checklists, no fluff |
| Website migrations | Moving from Wix/WordPress/expensive CMS to lean static sites |
| Custom software (Rails) | Web apps, automation, APIs |
| Linux/NixOS consulting | Server setup, hardening, self-hosting |
| Technical advisory | De-Googling, Framework laptops, Home Assistant, Pikapods |
| Open-source tools | patlog.co.uk (PAT testing), play-test (inflatable inspections), Checkatrade scraper, Google review link generator |

### The Chobble Template (The Product)

A free, open-source Eleventy v3 static site generator purpose-built for small business websites:
- 13 content types: Products, Categories, Events, News, Menus, Locations, Properties, Reviews, Team, Accreditations
- E-commerce: Stripe Checkout, PayPal, quote/enquiry mode, shopping cart
- 10 themes with live theme editor
- Responsive images with LQIP placeholders
- Schema.org structured data, RSS feeds, iCal
- Markdown editing via Git or PagesCMS
- Hosted on Bunny CDN for speed

### Client Portfolio (Proof of Work)

15 documented examples spanning: cafes, security companies, solar installers, bakeries, housing charities, folk clubs, ukulele groups, dessert shops, furniture retailers, cosmetics companies, play equipment inspectors, community groups, tabletop game companies.

**These example pages already contain case-study-quality material.** Several include problem/solution/outcome narratives:

| Example | Problem stated | Outcome stated | Case study potential |
|---------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Renegade Solar | Wix site: slow, no rankings, ~1 enquiry/year, hard to edit | ~1 enquiry/week, first-page rankings, perfect Lighthouse, sub-1s load | **Strongest** — has before/after numbers |
| A&S Home Furnishings | Expensive CMS, broken contact form, overpaying for hosting | £10/mo hosting, working forms, easy editing via Forgejo | **Strong** — has cost savings, migration narrative |
| Blue Pits Housing | Agencies quoted £2,500+, charity needed affordable site | £600-800 build at charity rate, £20/mo hosting, 14-year relationship | **Strong** — cost comparison, longevity |
| Play Safe Play Inspection | New business needed credible professional presence | 100% Lighthouse scores, PagesCMS self-editing, content from voice notes | **Medium** — good process story |
| House of Desserts | Needed menus without PDF downloads | Custom menu system built for template, easy staff editing | **Medium** — product improvement story |
| Southport Organics | Etsy fees too high, wanted direct sales | PagesCMS self-editing, Ghost newsletter, Stripe integration planned | **Medium** — platform independence story |
| This & That Cafe | Domain stolen by squatters, needed reclaiming | Domain recovered via Nominet, perfect Lighthouse, £10/mo hosting | **Medium** — rescue story |
| Button Kin Games | Needed games hub with direct purchasing | Lighthouse 95+, Stripe direct sales, no third-party commissions | **Low** — spouse's business, less objective |

The raw material is there. What's missing is: explicit before/after metrics, client quotes alongside outcomes, and a consistent "case study" framing that makes the EEAT value obvious to both Google and readers.

### Testimonials (Proof of Trust)

8 published reviews with specific outcomes:
- "One of my websites went from 7th to 2nd within 5 days"
- "Tenfold customer increase"
- Client relationships spanning 10+ years (since 2013)
- Recurring themes: transparent, trustworthy, knowledgeable, problem-solver

## Part 2: EEAT Analysis — Where You Stand Now

### Experience — STRONG

- 20+ years in web development
- 15 real client examples with descriptions of work
- Built and shipped open-source tools (patlog, play-test, Chobble Template)
- Blog posts documenting actual project work (Eleventy image processing, NixOS hardening, app development)
- Long-term client relationships (10+ years mentioned in reviews)

**Gaps:**
- Blog posts are sparse (20 total, many off-topic — baked beans, BYD FM tuner, Adrian Chiles)
- Example pages already contain case-study material (especially Renegade Solar, A&S Home Furnishings, Blue Pits) but aren't framed/labelled as case studies and lack consistent before/after metrics
- No "how I solved X for client Y" deep-dive content separate from the portfolio listing

### Expertise — STRONG on technical, WEAK on demonstrating it

- Deep Eleventy/static-site knowledge (you built a full template with 85+ includes, 34 layouts, 12 collection types)
- 14 educational guides covering SEO, content strategy, local business
- Video tutorials on SEO, Google Business, keyword strategy
- Understands and teaches EEAT principles (AI content guide explicitly references it)

**Gaps:**
- Guides are generic/beginner-level — they establish you know SEO basics but don't showcase advanced expertise
- No content demonstrating deep technical SEO knowledge (Core Web Vitals, structured data implementation, crawl budget, indexing strategies)
- No content connecting your technical skills (static sites, CDN hosting, image optimization) to SEO outcomes
- The Chobble Template has extensive SEO features built in but they're not documented or marketed as differentiators

### Authoritativeness — WEAK

- No external recognition signals (awards, speaking, publications, industry mentions)
- No backlinks from authoritative sources visible
- Professional network page is small (4 partners)
- No contributions to Eleventy ecosystem documentation
- Not positioned as an authority in any specific niche

**Gaps:**
- No guest posts on web development or SEO publications
- No presence in Eleventy community (despite building a significant template)
- No data-backed content that others would cite/link to
- The "friends" page is a missed opportunity for stronger reciprocal authority signals

### Trustworthiness — VERY STRONG

- Open-source everything (code visible, auditable)
- Published principles page with specific ethical commitments
- No contracts, no lock-in — clients can leave anytime
- 10% charitable donation (Against Malaria Foundation)
- Published pricing with no hidden fees
- 8 real testimonials with specific detail
- 50% deposit / 50% completion payment model

**Gaps:**
- No "About" page with Stef's full bio, photo, qualifications, journey
- Reviews are on chobble.com only — no Google Business reviews visible/linked
- No trust badges or third-party verification

## Part 3: Searcher Intent Mapping

### Who is searching for what Chobble offers?

| Searcher | Intent | Current content match |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Small business owner wanting a website | "web design [location]", "small business website" | Moderate — service pages exist at /services/* but are relatively thin and lack case study proof |
| Business owner with a slow/expensive site | "migrate from Wix", "WordPress alternatives" | Moderate — /services/website-migrations/ and /services/wix-site-edits/ exist but lack depth; A&S and Renegade Solar examples have the migration stories |
| Tradesperson needing a website | "electrician website", "plumber website design" | Moderate — guide exists for tradespeople |
| Restaurant/cafe owner | "restaurant website design Manchester" | Moderate — /services/restaurant-web-design/ exists, plus Avo Coffee, This & That, and House of Desserts examples. Could be stronger with cross-linking and local keywords. |
| Ethical/vegan business | "vegan web developer", "ethical web design" | Moderate — /services/vegan-business-websites/ exists with the discount. Sally's Bakes and Southport Organics are proof. Needs richer content connecting values to outcomes. |
| Business owner frustrated by SEO agencies | "honest SEO audit", "SEO without contracts" | Very weak — huge opportunity, no content targeting this |
| Developer looking for Eleventy templates | "eleventy business template", "11ty e-commerce" | Very weak — template exists but has no marketing content |
| Business owner wanting to learn SEO | "SEO guide small business", "how to improve Google ranking" | Moderate — 14 guides exist, but they compete with massive sites |
| Local Prestwich/Manchester businesses | "web developer Prestwich", "Manchester web design" | Weak — no dedicated local landing pages |

## Part 4: Actionable Jobs To Do

### HIGH IMPACT — Content that directly improves EEAT and targets searcher intent

#### 1. Write an "About Stef" page
**Why:** EEAT requires a named, credible human behind the content. Google's quality rater guidelines specifically look for author expertise signals.
**What to include:** Photo, 20+ year career summary, specific technologies mastered, clients served, open-source contributions, principles that drive the work, link to GitHub/Git profiles.

#### 2. Upgrade your best example pages into explicit case studies
**Why:** Case studies are the strongest EEAT signal — they prove Experience and Expertise simultaneously. You already have the raw material; it just needs restructuring.
**What to add to each:**
- A clear problem/solution/outcome structure (some pages already have this loosely)
- Specific before/after numbers where possible (Renegade Solar already has enquiry frequency)
- A client quote pulled from your reviews page or gathered fresh
- Cost comparison (what they were paying vs what they pay now)
- Link to live site + Lighthouse score screenshot

**Priority upgrades (these already have the strongest narratives):**
1. **Renegade Solar** — Wix migration, ~1/year to ~1/week enquiries, perfect Lighthouse. Add: old Wix load time vs new, old monthly cost vs £20/mo, Ashley's quote.
2. **A&S Home Furnishings** — CMS migration, broken forms, overpaying. Add: old hosting cost vs £10/mo, the wget/pandoc migration process is a unique technical story.
3. **Blue Pits Housing** — Agency quoted £2,500+, you did it for £600-800. Add: 14-year timeline, specific GDPR/accessibility work, charity impact.
4. **This & That Cafe** — Domain recovery from squatters via Nominet is a genuinely unusual story. Add: the Nominet process detail, before/after.
5. **Play Safe Play Inspection** — Voice-note-to-website pipeline is a distinctive process story. Add: how the content creation worked, Gary's perspective.

**Also consider writing up play-test separately as a product/app case study** — it's a Rails app with 90% test coverage, EN standard compliance, and a real user base. Different from the website examples and shows full-stack depth.

#### 3. Write "Why Static Sites Beat WordPress for Small Businesses"
**Why:** This targets the massive audience of business owners paying £50-200/month for WordPress hosting and maintenance, and positions your technical approach as the answer to their pain.
**Cover:** Speed (CDN vs shared hosting), security (no PHP/database = no hacks), cost (£10-40/mo vs £50-200/mo), SEO impact of Core Web Vitals, ownership (Markdown files vs database lock-in).

#### 4. Write "What a Chobble Template Site Gets You (And What It Costs)"
**Why:** The template is your most scalable product but has zero marketing content. Developers search for "eleventy business template" and business owners search for "affordable small business website".
**Cover:** Feature tour with screenshots, comparison to Squarespace/Wix/WordPress, real pricing, how editing works (PagesCMS), SEO features built in, what the 10 themes look like.

#### 5. Write "How I Build SEO Into Every Website From Day One"
**Why:** Connects your technical expertise (structured data, image optimization, CDN hosting, semantic HTML) to the SEO outcomes your clients care about. This is the missing bridge between your engineering and your marketing.
**Cover:** Schema.org markup you include, image pipeline (responsive images, LQIP, WebP/AVIF), Bunny CDN performance, semantic HTML structure, RSS feeds, how the template enforces good content hierarchy.

#### 6. Publish your Google Business reviews and link to your Google Business profile
**Why:** Reviews on your own site alone don't carry EEAT weight. Google trusts its own review platform and third-party review sites.

### MEDIUM IMPACT — Authority building and content depth

#### 7. Contribute to the Eleventy ecosystem
**Why:** Backlinks from 11ty.dev or the Eleventy community repos are high-authority, topically relevant signals.
**Options:** Submit the Chobble Template to the Eleventy starter projects list, write a technical blog post about your LQIP image approach (it's genuinely novel), contribute documentation.

#### 8. Write "The Real Cost of a Small Business Website in 2025" (data-backed)
**Why:** Comparison/data content gets linked to. Research real pricing from Wix, Squarespace, WordPress agencies, and freelancers. Show where Chobble fits. This is link-bait that also demonstrates expertise.

#### 9. Create dedicated location pages for Manchester and surrounding areas
**Why:** You literally wrote the guide on location pages — now follow your own advice.
**Pages:** Web developer in Prestwich, Manchester web design, North West web developer. Each with genuine local knowledge, client examples from that area, and specific detail.

#### 10. Expand the "Friends" page into a proper professional network
**Why:** Reciprocal links between genuine professional partners are legitimate authority signals.
**Action:** Ask each partner to link back. Write a paragraph about each relationship. Add more partners (the designers, copywriters, and marketers you refer clients to).

#### 11. Write "Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Web Developer"
**Why:** Targets frustrated searchers comparing agencies, positions you as the honest advisor, and naturally highlights Chobble's differentiators (open source, no contracts, transparent pricing).

#### 12. Turn your video content into written guides (or vice versa)
**Why:** You have 15 videos but they're invisible to search engines. Transcribe them into companion articles. Cross-link video and article.

### LOWER IMPACT — Maintenance and hygiene

#### 13. Audit your blog for topical relevance
**Why:** Posts about baked beans, BYD FM tuners, and Adrian Chiles dilute your topical authority. Search engines look at your site as a whole.
**Options:** Move off-topic posts to the personal blog (blog.chobble.com) and keep chobble.com/guides focused on web development, SEO, and small business.

#### 14. Add structured data to your guides
**Why:** FAQ schema, HowTo schema, and Article schema with author markup are direct EEAT signals.
**Your template already supports Schema.org** — make sure your own site uses it fully.

#### 15. Enrich the "SEO Audit" service page with deeper detail
**Why:** "SEO audit" is a high-value search term. Your page at /services/seo-audits/ exists and lists the service tiers, but it's relatively thin. Adding example audit findings, a redacted sample report, or a walkthrough of your process would demonstrate expertise and target commercial intent more effectively.

#### 16. Answer "People Also Ask" questions in your guides
**Why:** Google surfaces these in search results. Research what PAA questions appear for your target terms and add sections that directly answer them.

## Part 5: Content Principles (Based on Your Own Guides)

These are the rules you already teach your clients — codified for your own use:

1. **Write for humans first.** Natural language, conversational tone, contractions, personality.
2. **One topic per page.** Don't cannibalise your own rankings with overlapping content.
3. **Show, don't tell.** Specific details, real examples, measurable outcomes — never generic claims.
4. **Structure for scanning.** H2 subheadings, bold key points, short paragraphs, bulleted lists.
5. **Demonstrate, don't just state, expertise.** "I build fast websites" is a claim. "Here's how I reduced page load from 4.2s to 0.8s using Eleventy and Bunny CDN" is expertise.
6. **Link internally with intent.** Every guide should link to a relevant service page. Every service page should link to proof (case studies, reviews, portfolio).
7. **Avoid AI slop.** Your own guide says it well: "AI doesn't 'know' your specific business." Use it for editing, not for generation.
8. **Update, don't just publish.** Guides should show last-updated dates. Stale content signals abandonment.
